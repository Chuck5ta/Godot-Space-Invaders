# Godot-Space-Invaders
Space Invaders (1978) created using the Godot game engine

This is my means of getting used to game development. Initially creating 2D games (ChuckyEgg next), but with the intention of 3D and VR games in the future.

For a game or 2, I will recreate the classics, starting with Space Invaders (1978). 

Game assets are from: http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds

Game Engine: Godot
Language: GDScript

I was introduced to Godot via Gamedev.tv, while I was doing UE4 and Blender courses with them. They recently had a Kickstarter, as they will be creating Godot game development courses. I backed that and have jumped straight into messing about with game creation with the engine, and I am loving it so far :D
